In jQuery, the $ symbol is used to select elements on the page. However, when you want to select an element using an ID, you need to use the # symbol, which is a part of the jQuery selector syntax.

The reason you see double $$ in some cases is that the first $ is used to invoke the jQuery function, and the second $ is used to select the element using the # symbol.
